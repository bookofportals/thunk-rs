//! This crate provides functionality for thread-safe and non-thread-safe lazy
//! evaluation in Rust. It also provides functionality for generically working
//! with thunks of a given type.
//!
//! Three different thunk types are provided, all implementing `Lazy`:
//! * `Thunk`: a non thread-safe thunk.
//! * `AtomicThunk`: a thread-safe thunk, which implements `Send + Sync`.
//! * `Strict`: a strict, non-deferred thunk which always immediately
//!   evaluates whatever computation it's given, intended for genericity over
//!   strictness.
